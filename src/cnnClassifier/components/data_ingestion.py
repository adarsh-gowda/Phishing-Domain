"""os: Provides functions to interact with the operating system, such as checking for files and creating directories.
urllib.request as request: Allows us to make HTTP requests, particularly used here for downloading files from a URL.
zipfile: A module to handle ZIP file operations, like extracting ZIP files.
logger: Assumed to be a logging utility from the cnnClassifier package, which helps log information
             about the file download and extraction processes.
get_size: A utility function for calculating the file size, likely to log the size of existing files.
DataIngestionConfig: A configuration class that contains settings such as the data source URL, local file path,
                    and directory for extracted files.
Path: A part of pathlib for easier path manipulations (e.g., creating Path objects instead of using raw strings for paths)."""
